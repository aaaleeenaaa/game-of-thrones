# Game of Thrones page

Hello everyone and welcome to my Game of Thrones page! It includes a collection of houses, characters and quotes of the series based on the data of [this API](https://gameofthronesquotes.xyz/).

This project was created from a template to have a basic structure to begin with. It uses React, more precisely Next.js. The reasons for this are the following: First of all, I never used Angular or Vue before. I wanted, however, to deliver a product in the best quality I could in a time efficient way to prove that I am able to work well even with a restricted time frame. That is why I decided to use technologies I am already used to and not to dive into new ones. Nevertheless, I want to emphasize that I am definitely willing to broaden my horizon and to learn something new - I just felt that this project was not the right way for that.

Something important to mention about an aspect of the project: When on the page of a single character, all of its quotes are shown. It was originally asked that when clicking on a button, the quotes should be replaced by new ones of the same character. However, as some characters only have one quote or a very limited amount of quotes, I decided that completely replacing the quotes would not make sense. That is why I decided for a button that just changes the order of the character's quotes - which, however, of course does only work if there is more than one quote.

Thanks for having a look at this project and have a nice day!

## Local development

To run project commands locally, you need to install the dependencies using `npm i` first.

You can then use the following commands:

- `npm run dev` to start the development server - to actually see the visual outcome of the project
- `npm run build` to create a production build
- `npm run start` to start the production build
- `npm run test` to run the tests in watch mode (if available)
